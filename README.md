Clone the project, while in the project folder run 'npm install'. Then run 'npm start' to run the project. Open the /config/connection.js file for more information on the database connection.

Using the command line, run 'npm start' to start the application. Use your prefered software to interact with the database. I used Insomnia Core to test the route. The route is as follows:
